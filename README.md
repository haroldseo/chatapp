# chatapp
--
This app allows you to chat with other users, both globally and privately.

We also have a ChatBot, that acts as your personal assistant.

ChatApp can be found [here](https://sleepy-sands-62959.herokuapp.com/)

### How It Works
--
First, the user will be brought to a signup or login page, where they can either login to an existing account or create a new account. After logging in, the user will be taken to a global chatroom where all existing users can chat with each other. To have private 1-on-1 conversations, go to the users tab and click chat on the user you wish to chat with, this will open a private chatroom. There is also a ChatBot tab, where you can have small talk with our bot and ask questions.
